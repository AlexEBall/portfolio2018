                    After graduating from UCLA's full Stack Development Bootcamp, I've set my eyes on entering the tech world. With me I bring a passion 
                    for learning that goes far beyond the practical. The pursiut of things I don't know keeps me driven, humble and hungry to grow as much as I can. 
                <br />
                <br />
                    This mindset has led me to take quite well to programming. The breaking down of problems, the eloquent (and sometimes not so eloquent) solutions, the endless
                    learning have become my bread and butter. I love nothing more than to build immersive, robust applications that look to the future.

                                were scattered around the bridge, left behind when pilgrims made their desperate dives into the river. I was given all of

                                My team provisioned some <a href="https://estimote.com/" class="weblink">Estimote Beacons</a> and placed them around the musuem to test the power of the physical web. In order for the BLE technology
                                to transmit from the beacons to phones, one needs to turn on their bluetooth and location. We set signs up around the street
